A2 Assumptions:
---------------
	Variable declarations that are the only sub-statement in a selection or loop compound statement are not tracked in the symbol table, because the variable has no scope elsewhere in the program, and no other operations make use of it.

		ex.
			if (x < 10)
				int y;

			/* y does not show up in symbol table */
